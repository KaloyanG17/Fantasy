His lifelong commitment to football deserves recognition and praise, especially after Al-Masdar “was struck by shrapnel from a missile close to his home in the Gaza Strip's”, he became a martyr on the 6th of January 2024. However, his spirit, illuminating from the heavens above, will serve as a guiding light for my fantasy team, leading us to victory and his legacy will live on forever."

Choudhury, who plays for Leicester showed his solidatory with Palestine by flying the Palestinian flag high whilst celebrating his victory. His defensive position on the pitch, is also translated off the pitch, by defending Palestine at such a prolific event in the sporting world. As Choudhury defends Palestine so openly, particularly within the Western world, it shows his fearlessness, making him a great asset to my fantasy team as a right back."

After signing for the “West Bank Premier League team”, he was literally stopped from crossing at the Erez border, where “he was arrested and placed in administrative detention”. The Israeli occupation permeates every facet of life, even extending its reach into sports, stripping away the dignity and autonomy of Palestinians. Thus, I have decided to place Sarsak on the bench of my fantasy team, as a substitute: a metaphor symbolising that there is a physical barrier always stopping Sarsak from fulfilling his dreams."

Although Wadi secured a contract with a premier league team in the West Bank, his return to Gaza for a match against a local team meant “he was denied permission to return afterwards, despite holding a permit to travel both ways”. Therefore, his career in the West Bank league was very short-lived. Just like Sarsak, Wadi had a physical barrier preventing him from playing outside of Gaza, which is why he is also a substitute on my fantasy team."
