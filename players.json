Hamadeh “made history as the first active Israeli Premier League player to be called up to the Palestinian team,” showing his dedication and resistance to support and, more importantly, protect Palestine. Hamadeh completely changed the history of football in Palestine with his decision to change, and it embodies his position as a goalkeeper, whereby he wishes to lead and be the last man standing when an attack is against him, inside and outside the world of football."

      "info":"Saldaña came through the ranks at Palestino, which is the football club in Chile founded by Palestinian immigrants there in 1920. It is interesting, even after over 100 years of banishment in Chile, a player like Saldaña “opted to play for Palestine and made his debut against Oman in October 2023”. This shows his strength, determination and loyalty, which are perfect assets to support my defence. Not only this but playing for Palestine is not an easy thing to do, especially if you are from Chile and have to travel half-way around the world to represent your national team, his dedication to play and support Palestine, is exceptional and really reinforces the importance of resistence, especially as a left back. As a left back Saldaña has to stop and target an attacking force coincides, which is a symbolic of his ability to face a tougher fight and represent the Palestinians."

Even after such devasting, traumatic events, Abuimeir still risked his life to “pull his grandparents out of a rubble”.  Abuimeir’s strength, power, and selflessness mean that he is a perfect choice for my fantasy team. As a centre back, Abuimeir’s resistance is essential throughout such a competitive game. Not only this, but Abuimeir would make an exceptional captain because his morals and actions closely reflect the values of sportsmanship."

      "info":"Alrekhawi will take the spot of centre back in my fantasy team. As a centre-back, you have to remain composed while you are under attack. If there is a moment where you concede or are defeated, centre-backs have to remain strong and ensure they are not struck down again, ending in a fatality. Alrekhawi’s ability as a centre-back has been encapsulated through his near-death experience. In 2009, Alrekhawi literally “defied death and undergoing a miraculous recovery”. After his traumatic experience, his impressive career at “several clubs within the West Bank” shows his sincere dedication and passion to come back stronger, making him the perfect addition to my fantasy team as a centre-back."

Choudhury, who plays for Leicester, showed his solidarity with Palestine by flying the Palestinian flag high while celebrating his victory. His defensive position on the pitch is also translated off the pitch, by defending Palestine at such a prolific event in the sporting world. As Choudhury defends Palestine so openly, particularly within the Western world, it shows his fearlessness, making him a great asset to my fantasy team as a right back."

He was involved in trying to set up Canaan FC, a project to try to build a visibly and identifiably Palestinian football club in the ’48 territories that was meant to feed Palestinian players to European clubs. Kettlun’s determination, embodies his position on the pitch; as a midfielder, he must see opportunities on the pitch even before they arise. Kettlun's vision extended after his retirement and shows how his initiative to support Palestinians moving into European clubs plays on his forward-thinking and determination to seize opportunities, even if selflessly they were not necessarily opportunities for himself but more for the team.

Last year, Jaber changed his teams after “having become infuriated by events two years earlier when Palestinian families were forcibly removed from their homes in East Jerusalem,” which shows his strength and determination in making a stand to actively change teams—the perfect attributes for an attacking midfielder. While Jaber was playing for Israel, he was constantly reassured that he would not need to sing the “Israeli national anthem”, and that “sport should not mix with politics,” but Jaber found it difficult to separate the two. Jaber is a powerful asset in my fantasy squad, as he rebels against oppression and fixates on resilience against Israel."

      "info":"Abu Khadija was arrested just after, arguably, his most successful game. Terrifyingly, he was 'arrested on his way home hours after the club was crowned with the professional league title.' His story is powerful and is a metaphor for his position on the pitch. As a midfielder, you can go from the highs of getting up the pitch and scoring, ultimately winning the tournament, to having to defend a counterattack and stand strong, which symbolises Abu Khadija’s arrest. Abu Khadija’s resistance is an inspiration for many Palestinians, encouraging them to hold onto their dignity. "

I greet you, my beloved family, friends, and nation. Perhaps these are the last words and the last scene you see from us because we are in a difficult situation… but nothing happens in the dominion of Allah except what Allah wills.' Just before losing his life to an Israeli airstrike on March 11, 2024, Barakat showed not violence but peace, not distress but dignity, and most importantly, not fear but integrity. I truly admire his strength, which is why Barakat is such an integral player in my fantasy team. Barakat plays on the wing because, as a winger, when your team is losing, wingers often become isolated and find it difficult to play with the team. This could be a metaphor for the Israeli violence against Palestine, showing that Israeli violence was too strong to counterattack."

The genocidal violence happening to Palestinians does not mean their voices should be silenced; I have chosen to include Al-Wawi in my fantasy team to personify his dream. Throughout Edward Said’s ‘Permission to Narrate’ we see that knowledge is not truth but depicted by power relations, controlling what voices are heard and validated. I am validating Al-Wawi’s voice, positioning him centre stage as our striker, to show the power of his sacrifice."

      "info":"El Ghazi continuously defends and supports Palestine. Only recently was his contract terminated from his “German club Mainz” after posting a tweet that said, 'From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free.' Mainz claimed that his support for Palestine, was implying a 'destruction of Israel,' and this was not tolerated by the club. Undoubtedly, El Ghazi is a huge testament to my fantasy team, as he argued that “the loss of my livelihood is nothing compared to the hell being unleashed in Gaza.' El Ghazi, who is committed to acknowledging the suffering of Palestinians and the termination of his contract, says a lot more about Germany and their support for Israel than it does about him. El Ghazi’s commitment also brings to light the situation in the football sphere for a wider audience, mobilising forces of resistance. Positioning El Ghazi on the wing was a tactical decision, as it represents his external support as a player coming in from the side to assist his team."
