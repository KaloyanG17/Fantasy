Hamadeh, “made history as the first active Israeli premier league player to be called up to the Palestinian team”, showing his dedication, resistence to support and more importantly protect Palestine. Hamadeh completely changed the history of football in Palestine with his decision to change, and it embodies his position as a goalkeeper whereby he wishes to lead and be the last man standing when an attack is against him: inside and outside the world of football."

Even after such devasting, traumatic events, Abuimeir still risked his life to “pull his grandparents out of a rubble”.  Abuimeir’s strength, power and selflessness mean that he is a perfect choice for my fantasy team. As a centre back Abuimeir’s resistance is essential throughout such a competitive game. Not only this but, Abuimeir would make an exceptional captain, because already his morals and actions, closely reflect values of sportsmanship."

If there is a moment where you concede or are defeated, centre-back’s have to remain strong and ensure they is not struck down again, ending in a fatality. Alrekhawi’s ability as a centre-back has been encapsulated through his near-death experience. In 2009, Alrekhawi literally “defied death and undergoing a miraculous recovery”. After his traumatic experience, his impressive career at “several clubs within the West Bank” shows his sincere dedication and passion to come back stronger, making him the perfect addition to my fantasy team as a centre-back."

Choudhury, who plays for Leicester showed his solidatory with Palestine by flying the Palestinian flag high whilst celebrating his victory. His defensive position on the pitch, is also translated off the pitch, by defending Palestine at such a prolific event in the sporting world. As Choudhury defends Palestine so openly, particularly within the Western world, it shows his fearlessness, making him a great asset to my fantasy team as a right back."

After he was subject to arrest in 2016, when his house was raided, Al-Da’our livelihood was diminished. As an attacker, on the pitch, it is heart-breaking that off the pitch, he is the one being attacked, Al-Da’our becomes vulnerable. Typically, an attacker is focused and domineering, the pivotal part of a team, someone you rely on to take you to victory. With these qualities, his arrest was a time to stand strong and withstand pressure to make it over the line."

Last year, Jaber changed his teams after “having become infuriated by events two years earlier when Palestinian families were forcibly removed from their homes in East Jerusalem”, which shows his strength and determination in making a stand to actively change teams: the perfect attributes for an attacking midfielder. Whilst Jaber was playing for Israel he was constantly reassured that he would not need to sing the “Israeli national anthem”, and that “sport should not mix with politics”, but Jaber found it difficult to separate the two. Jaber, is a powerful asset in my fantasy squad as he rebels against oppression and fixates in resilience against Israel. "

      "info":"Abu Khadija was arrested just after, arguably, his most successful game. Terrifyingly, he was “arrested on his way home hours after the club was crowned with the professional league title”, his story is powerful and is a metaphor for his position on the pitch. As a midfielder you can go from the highs of getting up the pitch and scoring, ultimately winning the tournament, to having to defend a counterattack and stand strong which symbolises Abu Khadija’s arrest. Abu Khadija’s resistence, is an inspiration for many Palestinians, encouraging them to hold onto their dignity."

      "info":"Barakat our precious soul. In his final words Barakat showed so much love, strength and compassion: “peace be upon you and the mercy of Allah and His blessings. I greet you, my beloved family, friends, and nation. Perhaps these are the last words and the last scene you see from us because we are in a difficult situation… but nothing happens in the dominion of Allah except what Allah wills”. Just before losing his life to an Israeli air-strike, on the 11th of March 2024, Barakat showed not violence but peace, not distress but dignity and most importantly not fear but integrity. I truly admire his strength, which is why Barakat is such an integral player in my fantasy team. Barakat plays on the wing because as a winger when your team is losing, wingers often become isolated and find it difficult to play with the team. This could be a metaphor for the Israeli violence against Palestine, showing that Israeli violence was too strong to counterattack."

      "info":"El Ghazi, continuously defends and supports Palestine. Only recently was his contracted terminated from his “German club Mainz”, after posting a tweet that said “from the river to the sea Palestine will be free”. Mainz claimed that his support for Palestine, was implying a “destruction of Israel” and this was not tolerated by the club. Undoubtedly El Ghazi is a huge testament to my fantasy team, as he argued that “the loss of my livelihood is nothing compared to the hell being unleashed in Gaza”. El Ghazi is committed to acknowledging the suffering of Palestinians and the termination of his contract, says a lot more about Germany and their support for Israel than it does about him. El Ghazi’s commitment also brings to light the situation into the football sphere, to a wider audience, mobilising forces of resistence. Positioning El Ghazi on the wing, was a tactical decision, as it represents his external support as a player coming in from the sides to assist his team."
